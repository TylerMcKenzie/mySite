  <p>This site is comprised of a Rails 4 backend and an AngularJs frontend. I chose Rails mainly because that is the backend that I know best. Currently, my favourite frontend frame-work is Angular(which is why I chose it for this site). It also lets me be a bit more liberal with my Javascript code, but it is not without its bugs. These bugs are generally caused by rails routing, but I set up a redirect to solve that. Which in turn broke all of my anchor tags so I had to make a scroll service that solves that.</p>
